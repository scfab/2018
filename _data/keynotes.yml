  title: 'Applications of Verifiable Computation in Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies'
  abstract: 'Decentralized cryptocurrencies and smart contracts (e.g.,
  Bitcoin and Ethereum) promise to revolutionize financial industries,
  forever changing the way money is transferred. They support monetary
  transactions based on programmable logic between users without
  requiring to trust a central authority (e.g., a government or a bank).
  At the heart of their design lies the blockchain, a distributed data
  structure that is stored and agreed upon by the participating parties
  and which is readily accessible to anyone in the world. However, due
  to its size and public nature, several scalability, security and
  privacy concerns have emerged. In this talk I will show how we can use
  protocols for verifiable computation (cryptographic techniques that
  enable an untrusted party to efficiently prove the validity of a
  statement to a verifier), to address these problems.'
  bio1: 'Charalampos (Babis) Papamanthou is an assistant professor of
  Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland,
  College Park, where he joined in 2013 after a postdoc at UC Berkeley.
  At Maryland, he is also affiliated with the Institute for Advanced
  Computer Studies (UMIACS), where he is a member of the Maryland
  Cybersecurity Center (MC2). He works on applied cryptography and
  computer security---and especially on technologies, systems and theory
  for secure and private cloud computing. While at College Park, he
  received the NSF CAREER award, the Google Faculty Research Award, the
  Yahoo! Faculty Research Engagement Award, the NetApp Faculty
  Fellowship, the 2013 UMD Invention of the Year Award, the 2014 Jimmy
  Lin Award for Invention and the George Corcoran Award for Excellence
  in Teaching. His research is currently funded by federal agencies
  (NSF, NIST and NSA) and by the industry (Google, Yahoo!, NetApp and
  Amazon). His PhD is in Computer Science from Brown University (2011)
  and he also holds an MSc in Computer Science from the University of
  Crete (2005), where he was a member of ICS-FORTH. His work has
  received over 3,000 citations and he has published in venues and
  journals spanning theoretical and applied cryptography, systems and
  database security, graph algorithms and visualization and operations
  research.'
